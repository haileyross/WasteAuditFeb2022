## Content Comparisons
- average weight of a piece of trash, composting, and recycling item
```{r average-piece-weight}
waste_audit %>% 
  summarize(total_trash_pieces = sum(pieces_trash),
            total_recycle_pieces = sum(pieces_recycle),
            total_compost_pieces = sum(pieces_compost),
            total_trash_weight = sum(weight_trash_lbs), 
            total_recycle_weight = sum(weight_recycle_lbs),
            total_compost_weight = sum(weight_compost_lbs),
            average_trash_weight = total_trash_weight / total_trash_pieces,
            average_recycle_weight = total_recycle_weight / total_recycle_pieces,
            average_compost_weight = total_compost_weight / total_compost_pieces)
```

- comparative starting volume of pieces/weight between trash, recycle, and
compost streams
```{r starting-volumes}
waste_audit %>% 
  group_by(original_stream) %>% 
  summarize(avg_starting_weight = mean(total_can_weight),
            avg_starting_pieces = mean(total_piece_volume))
```

```{r bar-plot-original-stream-weight-comparison}

## Quantifying Missorted Waste
```{r missorted}
waste_audit <- waste_audit %>% 
  mutate(perc_missorted_c = case_when(original_stream == "trash" ~ (weight_recycle_lbs + weight_compost_lbs) / total_can_weight, original_stream == "recycling" ~ (weight_trash_lbs + weight_compost_lbs) / total_can_weight, original_stream == "compost" ~ (weight_trash_lbs + weight_recycle_lbs) / total_can_weight),
         missorted_count = case_when(original_stream == "trash" ~ (weight_recycle_lbs + weight_compost_lbs), original_stream == "recycling" ~ (weight_trash_lbs + weight_compost_lbs), original_stream == "compost" ~ (weight_trash_lbs + weight_recycle_lbs)),
         sorted_count = total_can_weight - missorted_count)
```

```{r bar-plot-original-stream-percent}
makeup <- waste_audit %>% 
  group_by(original_stream) %>% 
  summarize(average_trash = mean(prop_trash_weight),
            average_recycle = mean(prop_recycle_weight),
            average_compost = mean(prop_compost_weight)) %>% 
  select(average_trash, average_recycle, average_compost)
makeup <- as.matrix(makeup)
colnames(makeup) <- c("trash", "recycle", "compost")
rownames(makeup) <- c("Compost", "Recycle", "Trash")
color <- c("black", "#3265ab", "#2ca816")
barplot(t(makeup), beside = FALSE, col = color, ylim = c(0, 1.1),
        main = "Percent Actual Waste Composition in Trash, Recycling, and Compost", xlab = "Original Stream Designation", ylab = "Proportion")
legend("topleft", colnames(makeup), pch = 15, col = color, horiz = T, bty = "n")
```

- percent of total waste that is missorted

```{r missorted-total-waste}
pie_total <- waste_audit %>% 
  summarize(sorted = sum(sorted_count),
            missorted = sum(missorted_count))
pie_total
slices <- c(50.5, 138.7)
lbls <- c("properly sorted", "missorted")
percent <- slices / sum(slices) * 100
percent
pct <- round(percent)
lbls <- paste(lbls, pct)
lbls <-paste(lbls, "%", sep = " ")
pie(slices, labels = lbls, col = c("#2ca816", "#cc2900"), main = "Overall Contamination for All Streams")
# source: https://www.statmethods.net/graphs/pie.html
```

- Bootstrap Sample OVERALL WASTE

bootstrap sample

```{r bootstrap-sample-with-compost}
set.seed(201)
boot_missorted <- waste_audit %>% 
  specify(response = perc_missorted_c) %>% 
  generate(reps = 10000, type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean")
```

confidence interval

```{r confidence-interval-with-compost}
ci_boot_missorted <- get_ci(boot_missorted, level = 0.95)
ci_boot_missorted
```

bootstrap distribution

```{r bootstrap-vis-with-compost}
visualize(boot_missorted) +
  shade_ci(ci_boot_missorted) +
  labs(title = "Simulated Bootstrap Distribution of Overall Missorted Waste", x = "Sample Mean Missorted Overall Waste", y = "Count")
```

$\bar{x} \pm t^*\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$

more conservative than normal distribution; weight on tail ends

```{r t-distribution-with-compost, eval = FALSE}
mean(waste_audit$perc_missorted_c) + c(-1, 1) * 2.05 * sd(waste_audit$perc_missorted_c) / sqrt(44)
```
